                  I specialize in creating user-friendly interfaces and have a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML,
                  and CSS. Over the past two years,
                  I've worked on various projects ranging from small business websites to large-scale web applications.
                  My focus is on writing clean, efficient code and continuously improving my skills.

                  I began my journey as a web developer in 2022, and since then,
                  I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer,
                  taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                  After completing my degree, I started my web development journey,
                  building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js.

                  I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end,
                  from ideation all the way to development.
